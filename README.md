# Simulation. Topic 1, exercise 4: roller coaster.
Simulation subject within the Multimedia Engineering degree from the ETSE - Universitat de València. February 2022. Topic 1 (Basic concepts and numerical integrators in Simulation), exercise 4: roller coaster. The objective of the exercise is to simulate a roller coaster.

## Project setup
The user will be able to modify, through the code, the number of sections of the roller coaster. The slope of each of the sections is calculated randomly. In the ascending sections the mass has a lower speed depending on the slope. In the descending sections, the opposite happens.
